# Sentiment Analysis of the Role Play World (RPW) Community

### A Comprehensive Study on User Sentiments, Anonymity, and Social Interactions

## Description
This project focuses on the sentiment analysis of the Role Play World (RPW) community, a unique online space where users assume different identities, often of idols or fictional characters, to interact anonymously on social media platforms like Facebook. The study aims to understand user sentiments, explore the impact of anonymity on user experiences, and investigate how the RPW community fosters social interaction and personal expression.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the overall sentiment of users in the RPW community, with sentiment scores ranging from negative to very positive.
- **User Experience Analysis:** Investigates how different respondent types and interview sections influence sentiment.
- **Impact of Anonymity:** Explores how anonymity in RPW allows for open communication, self-expression, and the development of a supportive community.
- **Correlation Studies:** Examines the relationship between user experience (years of RPW use) and sentiment.

## Methodology
This study builds upon the qualitative findings of a previous investigation into the Role Play World (RPW) community by employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and other quantitative methods to analyze user sentiments. The methodology is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of user experiences and sentiments within the RPW community.

## Results
The analysis reveals a generally positive sentiment within the RPW community, with variations across different user groups and interview sections. The findings suggest that anonymity plays a crucial role in facilitating open communication and positive interactions.

## Conclusion
The RPW community offers a unique platform for users to express themselves freely, often leading to positive social interactions and personal growth. This study highlights the importance of anonymity in creating a supportive online environment.

## Future Work
Further research could explore the long-term effects of RPW participation on user behavior, the impact of anonymity on mental health, and the potential for using sentiment analysis to improve online community experiences.
